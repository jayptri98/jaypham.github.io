    <h1>Jay Pham's favorite drink</h1>
    <p>
        I don’t know if you have tried <b>Bubbles Milk Tea</b> yet,
        but it’s viral. If you haven’t tried <b>Bubbles Milk Tea</b>,you don’t know what you are missing.
        Milk tea is not a combination to be messed with.
        It’s God’s gift to mankind for bad days and not so bad days.
        It is Taiwan original got its name from the drink’s frothy finish foam forms
        when the teas are shaken to mix the tea with ice, thus creating <i>bubbles</i>.
